# SCBI Leaf Phenology
This folder contains files on leaf phenology observations at SCBI (raw data)

## Sampling dates
Fall 2013, Spring 2014, Fall 2014

## Sampling location
ForestGEO plot at SCBI, two tree clusters in the south side of plot.

## Protocols
We adapted methods from Augspurger & Bartlett, 2003 to categorize both spring and fall leaf phenology events.

## Metadata (fall phenonoly)
|Column	|Field	|Description |Units/format |
|---|---|---|---|
|1|	Tag|Unique tree identifier number corresponding to a metal tag of a given tree within the ForestGEO plot	|NA
|2| stemID|	Individual stem identifier, default is 1 if plant is single stemmed	|NA
|3| Latin	|Latin plan name (genus, species)	|NA
|4| dbh.2013.mm	|Diameter at breast height as ForestGEO census 2013	|milimeters
|5| Date|	Date of observation	|MM/DD/YEAR
|6| perc.canopy.completeness	|Percentage of canopy fullness (0%= total leaf drop)	|NA
|7| perc.pigmentation 	|Percentage of leaf pigmenation (breakdown of clorophyll, revealing urderlying pigments)	|NA
|8| notes	|Any notes in the field	|NA

## Metadata (spring phenonoly)
|Column	|Field	|Description |Units/format |
|---|---|---|---|
|1|	Tag|Unique tree identifier number corresponding to a metal tag of a given tree within the ForestGEO plot	|NA
|2| stemID|	Individual stem identifier, default is 1 if plant is single stemmed	|NA
|3| species	|species code as used in main ForestGEO census |NA
|4| dbh.2013.mm	|Diameter at breast height as ForestGEO census 2013	|milimeters
|5 to 17| Date|	Date of observation/Leaf expansion categories*|MM/DD/YEAR

*Leaf expansion categories: 0= closed buds, 1= beginning of bud break (bud scales parted, revealing underlying leaf tissue in more than one-third of buds), 2= leaves partially unfold in 33-66% of canopy leaves, 3= completion of leaf expansion (more than two-thirds of leaves are full-sized, flattened, and in normal orientation)
