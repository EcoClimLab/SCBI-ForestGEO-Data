# SCBI tree mortality 

## Sampling location
[SCBI ForestGEO plot](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/north-america/smithsonian-conservation-biology-institute)


## Sampling dates
2014- 2018 


## Protocols

The basic census is described in [Gonzalez-Akre et al. (2016)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.1595). This covers all methods used in 2014 and 2015.

Since 2016, we started monitoring all ash tress (*Fraxinus spp.*) stems down to 1cm DBH in order to capture dynamics of emerald ash borer infestation. The protocols since 2016 are available [here](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/blob/master/tree_mortality/Protocols/Mortality%20Protocol%202018.pdf)

All trees found dead in 2016 and 2017 were cored at breast height and their base except in areas where extreme rot or other hazards prevented boring or resulted in a very poor quality core. Tree core data is [here](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/tree_cores).

We have been paying increasing attention to signs of insect pests and pathogens on newly dead and unhealthy trees. A list of pests and pathogens that may affect our trees is given [here](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/species_lists/insects_pathogens).


## Data use

2014 and 2015 mortality census data used in [Gonzalez-Akre et al. 2016](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.1595) are published [in Dryad](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v5h24.) and may be used as detailed in the metadata of this publication, as may updated versions of those datasets in this repository.

**Data from 2016-2018 censuses are currently being used in analyses and may not be used without permission of the PI (Kristina Anderson-Teixeira).** We welcome inquiries about potential collaboration.
