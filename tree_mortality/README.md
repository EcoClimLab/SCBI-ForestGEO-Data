# SCBI tree mortality 

## Sampling location
[SCBI ForestGEO plot](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/north-america/smithsonian-conservation-biology-institute)


## Sampling dates
2014- 2018 


## Protocols

The basic census is described in [Gonzalez-Akre et al. (2016)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.1595). This covers all methods used in 2014 and 2015.

Since 2016, we started monitoring all ash (*Fraxinus spp.*) stems down to 1cm DBH in order to capture dynamics of emerald ash borer infestation.

All trees found dead in 2016 and 2017 were cored at breast height and their base except in areas where extreme rot or other hazards prevented boring or resulted in a very poor quality core. Tree core data is [here](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data_private/tree/master/tree_cores).

We hahve been paying increasing attention to signs of insect pests and pathogens on newly dead and unhealthy trees. A list of pests and pathogens that may affect our trees is given [here](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/species_lists/insect_pests_pathogens).
