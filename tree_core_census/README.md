## Sampling dates
Census 1: 2008-2010

## Protocols

See [Bourg et al. 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-0010.1/full) for protocols at SCBI and [Condit 1998](https://books.google.com/books?id=MgNJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT13&lpg=PT13&dq=condit+ctfs+book&source=bl&ots=4tBk2TwRxN&sig=X7CEJVmFXH0F6_TB06S09gd3J7U&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiZ0Mv9z6TeAhUGneAKHQbRAJoQ6AEwBnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=condit%20ctfs%20book&f=false) for original protocols at CTFS-ForestGEO plots.
