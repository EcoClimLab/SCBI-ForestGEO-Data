## SCBI-Tree dimensions
Various measurements on trees at the SCBI plot are stored in this repository 
- Compilation of all conventional [tree height measurements](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/tree_dimensions/tree_heights)
- [Compilation](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/tree_dimensions/tree_crowns) of crown position, via list of cored trees and full geographic coordinates
- Bark thickness, copied here from this [Dryad data publication](https://datadryad.org//resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.6nc8c?show=full) accompanying [Anderson-Teixeira *et al.* 2015, *Functional Ecology*](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2435.12470). The former contains data, latter describes allometries.
