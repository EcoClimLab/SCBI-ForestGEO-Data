# SCBI crown position

The data_entry_form.csv file has all trees that are cored, in addition to trees in the biannual dendroband survey (and by extension, the intraannual). 
- This file was created from the full merged file (with geographic coordinates and accompanying R-script explaining how it was made), found in the [Dendrobands repo](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/Dendrobands/blob/master/data/clean_data_files/dendro_cored_full.csv).
- As a reminder, dbh is in mm

Protocol for determining crown position is based on [Jennings 1999](https://academic.oup.com/forestry/article/72/1/59/589132) pages 69-70.
