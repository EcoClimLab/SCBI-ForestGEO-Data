# README for crown position

The data_entry_form.csv file has all trees that are cored, in addition to trees in the biannual dendroband survey (and by extension, the intraannual). 
- This file was created from the full merged file (with geographic coordinates and accompanying R-script explaining how it was made), found in the [Dendrobands repo](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/Dendrobands/blob/master/data/clean_data_files/dendro_cored_full.csv).
