# Taking Height Measurements

## Tangent method

### Impulse_200LR_rangefinder.pdf
This is the manual for the Impulse 200LR rangefinder, which is what Thompson used in 2012/2013 for his height measurements in the SCBI_tree_heights.csv. This uses the tangent method, where the rangefinder calculates the distance between you and the tree from a laser. It then uses the angle between you and the top (and base) of the tree to determine height. *This doesn't require you needing to have a direct line of sight to the top (and base) of the tree, as a laser is not required for getting the angle*.

## Sine method

### height_methods_Muller-Landau_2013.pdf
This document (Larjavaara & Muller-Landau) describes why the sine method is better for calculating tree heights than the tangent method. It has a more thorough description of the two methods (pg 794) than Chave 2005.
- For the sine method to work, the rangefinder must calculate the hypotenuse using a laser. Using that distance plus the angle at which the hypotenuse was calculated, it determines the height using sine. This means, you must have a direct line of sight to the base of the tree and the top of tree.
- NB: The sine method is "faster to learn, displayed less variation in heights among technicians, and had lower random error, but resulted in systematic underestimation by 20% on average."

This is the manual for the Nikon ForestryPro rangefinder that the lab has (as of May 2019). This rangefinder uses the sine method.

## How to Take Height Measurements with the Nikon ForestryPro.
In the past, in order to get an accurate height of a tree, you made a triangle between yourself and the tree, got the angle/distance to the top using a clinometer, and calculated the height using the sine method (sin(x) = opposite/hypotenuse).

Now, rangefinders like the Nikon ForestryPro do this for you (using the sine method).
1. You must be at least 10m away from the tree and have a clear view of the base.
2. Turn the rangefinder on and make sure the units are in m.

    2a. NB this rangefinder turns itself off after about 30 sec of non-use.
3. Point the rangefinder at the base, and press the first button (the power button). It will give the height from your eye to the base of tree. Record.
4. From your same position, point the rangefinder to the top leaves you can see of the tree, and press the same first button. You will get another height, which is the height of the tree from your eye. Record.
5. If your eyes are above the base of the tree, add the two heights together to get the total. Otherwise, if your eyes are below the base of the tree, subtract your base measurement from the canopy measurement. This is referred to as the "2-point method" in the ForestryPro manual.
6. To be fully accurate, steps #1-5 should be done in two separate places for the same tree, then take the average of the two height measurements, since we can't always get a full canopy picture from just one side.
7. If you want to know the angles and distances, these appear on the side screen after you get the height.
8. If you hold down the first button as you scan up the tree, the number/diagram on the screen will constantly update (because the rangefinder is constantly shooting laser pulses). This is not necessary but it can be done.

These steps are also outlined on [this website](https://www.monumentaltrees.com/en/content/measuringheight/) with graphics. For easy access, it is recommended data collectors load this website on their phone for reference *before* going out in the field.
- For anyone questioning the accuracy of the Nikon ForestryPro, it can be tested with an object of known height. In 2018 it was tested against a NEON tower, and the result was very accurate.



### height_methods_Chave_2005.pdf
This document describes how to calculate the height of a tree using an older rangefinder and a height meter. This method is obsolete given the more advanced rangefinders like the Nikon ForestryPro, but it is included here for reference.
