# Taking Height Measurements

## How to Take Height Measurements with the Nikon ForestryPro.
In the past, in order to get an accurate height of a tree, you made a triangle between yourself and the tree, got the angle/distance to the top using a clinometer, and calculated the height using the sine method (sin(x) = opposite/hypotenuse).

Now, rangefinders like the Nikon ForestryPro do this for you (using the sine method).
1. You must be at least 10m away from the tree and have a clear view of the base.
2. Turn the rangefinder on and make sure the units are in m.

    2a. NB this rangefinder turns itself off after about 30 sec of non-use.

3. Point the rangefinder at the base, and press the first button (the power button). It will give the height from your eye to the base of tree. Record.
4. From your same position, point the rangefinder to the top leaves you can see of the tree, and press the same first button. You will get another height, which is the height of the tree from your eye.
5. Add the two heights together to get the total (this is referred to as the "2-point method" in the ForestryPro manual).
6. If you want to know the angles and distances, these appear on the side screen after you get the height.
7. If you hold down the first button as you scan up the tree, the number/diagram on the screen will constantly update (because the rangefinder is constantly shooting laser pulses). This is not necessary but it can be done.

These steps are also outlined on [this website](https://www.monumentaltrees.com/en/content/measuringheight/) with graphics. For easy access, it is recommended data collectors load this website on their phone for reference *before* going out in the field.

This is the manual for the Nikon ForestryPro rangefinder that the lab has (as of May 2019).

### height_methods_Muller-Landau_2013.pdf
This document (Larjavaara & Muller-Landau) describes why the sine method is better for calculating tree heights than the tangent method. It has a more thorough description of the two methods (pg 794) than Chave 2005.

### height_methods_Chave_2005.pdf
This document describes how to calculate the height of a tree using an older rangefinder and a height meter. This method is obsolete given the more advanced rangefinders like the Nikon ForestryPro, but it is included here for reference.
