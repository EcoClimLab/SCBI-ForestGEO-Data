1/A,tag,Tag number used in the field to identify individual trees ,-
2/B,stemtag,"Individual stem identifier, default is 1 if plant is single stemmed ",-
3/C,stemID,unique stem identifier for the ForestGEO census,-
4/D,species.code,Species mnemonic,-
5/E,species,Species latin name,-
6/F,height.year,year in which height was measured,-
7/G,height.m,tree heigth,m
8/H,DBH.2008.cm,tree diameter recorded in 2008 ForestGEO census,cm
9/I,DBH.2013.cm,tree diameter recorded in 2013 ForestGEO census,cm
10/J,DBH.TLS.2015.cm,"tree diameter as measured by terrestrial laser scanning (terrestrial LiDAR) in 2015. Though these differed from the field dbh in 2013, a threshold of 10cm was applied, whereby if the TLS dbh was >10cm above or below the field dbh, then the TLS dbh was not used. Instead, those trees have the DBH.2013.cm reported.",cm
11/K,DBH.2018.cm,tree diameter recorded in 2018 ForestGEO census,cm
12/L,DBH.with.height.cm,"tree diameter measured at the same time as height,  and by the same researcher",cm
13/M,instrument,"the rangefinder or alternate method (clinometer, tape, etc) used to get height measurements",-
14/N,method,"the method by which measurements were collected, either manually (rangefinder or clinometer) or automatically (LiDAR)",-
15/O,method_math,"mathematical method of calculating height, either done by the rangefinder or by hand. This is either ""tangent"" or ""sine""",
