# Main census data

## rdata and csv files

Descriptions of these files can be found in the [metadata](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/tree_main_census/metadata).

Census3_coord_local_plot.csv is the full record of local and global coordinates for tagged trees. This was downloaded as .txt directly from CTFS toward the end of data entry for the 3rd census, then converted to csv.
