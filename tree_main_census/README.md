# SCBI Tree census

## Overview 
This [folder](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/tree_main_census/data) contains the _R Analitical tables_ for census 1 (2008) and census 2 (2013) at SCBI (also available in .csv format). 
R tables are created once all data have been checked and corrected after a tree survey is finished in a ForestGEO plot. In general, each plot have a `full table` and a `stem table` per census. This is the most convenient format for analyzing census data using R functions from the ForestGEO R Package available [here](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/).

## Sampling location
[SCBI ForestGEO plot](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/north-america/smithsonian-conservation-biology-institute)

## Sampling dates
- Census 1: 2008-2010
- Census 2: 2013

## Protocols

See [Bourg et al. 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-0010.1/full) for protocols at SCBI and [Condit 1998](https://books.google.com/books?id=MgNJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT13&lpg=PT13&dq=condit+ctfs+book&source=bl&ots=4tBk2TwRxN&sig=X7CEJVmFXH0F6_TB06S09gd3J7U&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiZ0Mv9z6TeAhUGneAKHQbRAJoQ6AEwBnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=condit%20ctfs%20book&f=false) for original protocols at CTFS-ForestGEO plots.

## Metadata

Check metadata and other details for [full table](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/blob/master/tree_core_census/metadata/CTFS_R_FORMATTED_DATA_TABLES_Full.pdf) and [stem table](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/blob/master/tree_core_census/metadata/CTFS_R_FORMATTED_DATA_TABLES_Stem.pdf).

## Species

List of tagged tree species can be found [here](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/tree/master/species_lists/Tree%20ecology)

## Data use

Data for Census 1 at SCBI is public in Bourg et al. 2013. However, the offical master version for all censusses at ForesgtGEO sites resides in the [CTFS-ForestGEO Portal](http://ctfs.si.edu/datarequest/index.php/main). If you plan to publish work using this data please fill the request form for SCBI tree data [here](http://ctfs.si.edu/datarequest/index.php/request/form/9).
