Today I fixed some data in files for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 surveys. Mostly inclduing.

-wrote tag number in tag# column for all years if there was a note in 2017 'Notes' column (i.e. Probably tag #2730-00),
but not all, many still need to be revised.

-Eliminated duplicates in 2017 data (except few tags)
