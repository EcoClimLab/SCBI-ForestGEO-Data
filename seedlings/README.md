# SCBI Seedlings 

## Sampling location
[SCBI ForestGEO plot](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/north-america/smithsonian-conservation-biology-institute)

## Sampling dates
2010- 2019 (no sampling during 2013 and 2018)

## Protocols
Initial protocols are described in [Bourg et al. 2013](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/13-0010.1) covering methods used in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Few modifications were added after 2014, in particular, seedlings under 10 cm tall were not tagged,
and leaves were not counted. In addition, fewer plots were measured (mostly due to lack of funding).

## Publications using these data

Seedling data from 2010-2012 and methods are published in [Bourg et al. 2013](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/13-0010.1).  
* [McGarvey et al 2013](http://ctfs.si.edu/Public/pdfs/McGarveyEtAl.NENat2013.pdf) studied the effects of deer chronic browsing in Eastern forest. 
* [Ramage et al. 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.3298) investigated how sapling growth rates were affected by conspecific adult neighbors
