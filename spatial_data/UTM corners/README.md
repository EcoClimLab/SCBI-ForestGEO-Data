The [UTM corner file](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data/blob/master/spatial_data/UTM%20corners/scbi_UTM_plot_corners.csv) is based on the elevation (in m) of several points throught the SCBI plot. 
Explanation for the sampling design is described in [Bourg et al. 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-0010.1/full) and summarized here:
The locations of the plot center post and corners and midpoints of the plot perimeter were
located with a Trimble GEOXHTM 2005 Series GPS unit with external antenna and their coordinates geo-Â­corrected to the
nearest base stations in the area
