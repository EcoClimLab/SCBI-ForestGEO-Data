# SCBI plot elevation data

## Overview
The elevation file is based on the elevation (in m) of several points throught the SCBI plot. 
Explanation for the sampling design is described in [Bourg et al. 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-0010.1/full) and summarized here:

_In 2008 the LFDP was delineated in the forested portion of the Posey Creek watershed of
SCBI by choosing a starting center point and surveying the plot into 20 × 20 m quadrats, using a tripod-­mounted Laser
Technologies Impulse 200 LR laser rangefinder, high reflectance target, staff compass, and measuring tapes. The plot is
oriented to 350° on its north-­south axis and 80° on its east-­west axis. Each quadrat corner was marked with a 1.27 cm (0.5
inch) diameter iron rebar painted bright blue at the top. A numbered metal tag was attached with steel wire to each rebar. The
quadrat numbering system began with 01,01 in the southwest corner (origin) of the plot and continued at 20m intervals along
the x-­axis (east-­west direction) to 400 m (rebar 21,01). Numbering along the y-­axis (north-­south direction) was continued
similarly to 640 m (rebar 01,33)._
