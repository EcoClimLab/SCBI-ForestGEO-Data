# Forest Insects & Pathogens at SCBI
This folder contains a list of forest insect and pathogen species that may affect tree health at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.

Additional lists for a broader region include [Aukema et al. 2010](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi:10.5063/AA/nuding.7.6) and [Liebhold et al. 2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.12112).

## Summary
This list was compiled in 2017-2018 to identify pests and pathogens that may contribute to tree mortality in the SCBI ForestGEO plot and neighboring Shenandoahh National Park. It includes all species that are known or suspected to have contributed significantly to tree mortality at SCBI, along with native pests and pathogens that may contribute to mortality and invasives with potential to affect the region. It is unlikely to be a comprehensive list. It is based on a variety of sources, including scientific publications, gray literature (not formally peer-reviewed), credible internet sources, and communication with forest health professionals in the region. Particular attention was given to non-native pests and pathogens and to those known to affect tree taxa that have declined at SCBI or Shenandoah since forest monitoring began (mid-1990's and late 1980's, respectively).
