# Metadata for pests_pathogens

At this point, this metadata document is just an explanation of fields that aren't pretty self-explanatory.


### Virginia_Blue_Ridge_status
in order from most to least worrisome :

nascent = warning by the feds, state scientists, or a scientific publication that it could cause damage locally in the near future. I only listed as nascent if a reliable source specifically purposed watching out for it in the future

possible = exists nearby and has the ability to infest local forests

potential = exists somewhere in the US and feeds on similar tree species
