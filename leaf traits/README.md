## Summary
This dataset of leaf traits from trees and shrubs at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute-ForestGEO Large Forest Dynamic Plot includes measurements for leaf size, leaf fresh and dry mass, leaf area, and calculation of specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf mass per area (LMA). A total of 56 species were sampled in natural ambient conditions. Each record correspond to an individual leaf. The data set contains one *.csv file: Leaf_traits_SCBI_ForestGEO.csv.

This data will soon be open access at TRY Plant Trait Database (www.try-db.org), data can be requested through website.
