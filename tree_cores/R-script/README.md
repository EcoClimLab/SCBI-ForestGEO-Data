# R scripts for SCBI tree core data

This folder contains scripts used to manipulate data within this repository. They are not necessarily fully functional or up to date (i.e., not necessarily updated following changes to the repository).

- [Standardize_rwl_to_csv.R](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data_private/blob/master/tree_cores/R-script/Standardize_rwl_to_csv.R)- reformats tree core measurement files from .rwl to .csv, storing the results [here](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data_private/tree/master/tree_cores/cross-dated_cores_CSVformat)

- [Sort_rwl files_by_live.dead.R](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data_private/blob/master/tree_cores/R-script/Sort_rwl%20files_by_live.dead.R) 

- [wavelets_with_dplR.R](https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/SCBI-ForestGEO-Data_private/blob/master/tree_cores/R-script/wavelets_with_dplR.R)- Taken from http://r.adu.org.za/web/packages/dplR/vignettes/timeseries-dplR.pdf and modified to run on our data. As of Nov 2018, we've experimented with this and are not using for analysis.
